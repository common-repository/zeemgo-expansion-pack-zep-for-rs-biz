Zeemgo Expansion Pack (ZEP) plugin adds features from the RS Biz WordPress theme options page to your WordPress edit pages.


== Description ==

Zeemgo Expansion Pack (ZEP) plugin (the free version) adds features from the RS Biz WordPress theme options page to your WordPress edit pages. It requires you to have the RS Biz theme. However, it is separate from the RS Biz theme options page and will not conflict with the theme's original design and functionality.

See live demo of the plugin in action: http://demo.zeemgo.com/eprsbiz/

These features are specifically designed for individual pages only (not yet blog posts), so that your inner pages can all have their own unique look:

* RS Biz Top Bar Options: Top Bar Text, Phone Number, and Text Before Phone Number on Top Bar features.
* RS Biz Video Options: YouTube Video Code, Headline Below Video, and Embed Video/Image Code features.
* RS Biz Footer Options: Footer Headline feature.
* Easy to install.

In the paid version (http://zeemgo.com/plugins/eprsbiz/) you will get the features in the free version AND the two following features below:

* RS Biz Background Options: Color Scheme, Page Background Color, and Image Behind Video features.
* RS Biz Bullet List Below Video Options: List Item #1-10, and List Item #1-10, Optional Description features.
* Easy to install.


== Installation ==

3. Upload the unzipped files from your hard drive to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your web site's server.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
5. To configure this plugin, click on the `Configure` link under the plugin name or click on the `Zep Feautures` menu on left side of the WP-Admin screen.


== Screenshots ==

1. Screenshot of where to find the configuration link.
2. Screenshot of the configuration/set up page. This screenshot combines the features of the free version and paid version of the plugin. This way you can see what you'd also get in the paid version. The free version comes with only 3 features and the paid version consists of all 5 features.
3. Screenshot of where to start personalizing your pages using the plugin. When you install the plugin, you will only see 3 features on the actual add/edit pages in WP-Admin, since only 3 of the 5 in the screenshot are included in the free version. Get the paid version in order to get all 5 features to appear on your pages (as shown in the screenshot).
